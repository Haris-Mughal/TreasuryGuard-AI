# 🚀 Treasury Guard AI  
**Autonomous, AI-powered treasury protection for DAOs on NEAR**  

## 🌟 Overview  
Treasury Guard AI is a **NEAR-powered autonomous agent** that safeguards DAO and DeFi treasuries in **real time**.  
Built on the **Shade Agent Framework** with **Trusted Execution Environments (TEE)**, it can monitor markets, predict risks, and execute strategies — all without relying on centralized control.  

💡 **Tagline:**  
> *Your DAO’s autonomous financial bodyguard.*

## 🎯 Problem  
DAO treasuries today are vulnerable to:  
- 🕑 **Slow responses** to market events  
- 🏦 **Manual intervention** for asset management  
- ❌ **Centralized bots** prone to hacks and mismanagement  
- 🔓 **Key exposure risks** when automating  

---

## 💡 Solution  
Treasury Guard AI:  
- **Autonomous Agent:** Runs verifiably inside a **TEE** for privacy and security  
- **AI-Powered Decisions:** Predicts risks & triggers predefined safe actions  
- **On-chain Execution:** Directly interacts with NEAR smart contracts  
- **Cross-chain Ready:** Works with EVM chains via Aurora & chain abstraction
